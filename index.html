              <h2>Jamie Floyd:<em>Upper West Side Classic 6</em></h2><br>
              <p>"Ray Romano rocks. Listen to this: He did a complete GUT on an eight-room wreck in less than 8 weeks. <br>
                 I do not recommend it for anyone. It is CRAZY. But we have little kids and we had no choice. Ray <br>
                  Romano and his team got it done! The place is beautiful!"</p>
                  <br>
               <h2>Donna and Scott:<em> Rescued Renovation</em></h2>  <br>
               <p>"Ray rescued us from a contractor job gone bad. He and his crew are great, neat and real artisans. We <br>
                 recommend him very highly and I bet before we know it, there will be another "Everybody loves <br>
                  Raymond," but on HGTV or TLC!"</p>
                  <br>
                  <h2>David Siegel: <em>Doubled the Value</em></h2> 
                  <br>
                  <p>"Ray added value in ways that other G.C.s can't. Working with him is a pleasure. He more than doubled <br>
                     the value of my apartment through his gut renovations. I would recommend him to any person looking <br>
                      to make home improvements."</p>
